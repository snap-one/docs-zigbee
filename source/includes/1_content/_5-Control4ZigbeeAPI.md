# Control4 Zigbee API

The DriverWorks SDK support for Zigbee functionality was originally delivered in release 1.6.1. The API information included in the SDK will support the development of DriverWorks Zigbee functionality so that partners using the Zigbee SDK can integrate into the Control 4 system. Functionality includes:

- Allowing DriverWorks driver developers to send data to and receive data from ZigBee devices using either EmberNet or ZigBee Pro

- Allow ZigBee SDK developers the ability to update their ZigBee devices using DriverWorks.

- Allow ZigBee SDK developers the ability to utilize the Control4 identification mechanism, but define their own ID strings.


For more information, please see the [DriverWorks Zigbee Interface][1] in API Reference Guide.
